# Fileutils
## Motivation
From time to time I need to search for certain files, copy those files and grep its contents. That can be easily done with bash scripting, but it started to become hard to mantain a lot of different scripts.

The idea is that I have a main _toolkit_ with multiple operations, instead of a bunch of bash scripts.

## Suggested usage
Add an alias to call `fileutils` from anywhere, or add `fileutils` to your path.
